Mutation is a distinct int and every mutator specifies its own set of values
i.e a seq mutator has SeqGrow, SeqShrink, SeqAdd, SeqDelete, SeqSwap, SeqCrossover.
The function signature is proc (x: var T; m: Mutation; sizeIncreaseHint: int; enforceChanges: bool; r: var Rand): bool
The sampler is passed a (mutation, int (position)) tuple and a weight (0-100) for each possible mutation (canGrow bool).

Pro: Faster mutations (one less copy of the selected item), verified by a previous prototype.
Pro: Easier to calculate sizeIncreaseHint inside mutator?!
Pro/Con: You now have to provide a list with the mutations and the weights for each.
Con: Could produce twice as many duplicates.

Ideas:
- Make the post-processor work only for objects/seq/string/set.
- Assign smaller weight for mutating the discriminator field.
