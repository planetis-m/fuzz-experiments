Tasks breakdown DRAFT
---------------------

- [X] Figure out `set[enum]`. Must work with holey enums. (1.5h) (23/7)
- [X] Port fixUtf8 to safe Nim, run tests. (1.25h) 18/7
- [X] Replace rand with a sampler, find how, make changes to the spec, write pseudocode. Failed, nested recursion can lead to SO. (3.5h) 25-26/7
- [X] Port LPM sampler, run tests. (1.0h) 27/7
- [X] Write a prototype SrcSampler that uses Any from std/typeinfo. Failed, leaks when switching branches. (1.0h) 27/7
- [X] Adjust algorithm due to recent failure, plan accordingly. (1h) 27/7
- [X] Figure out how to generalize zah's prototype. Works with custom datatypes/refs/etc (3h) 28-29/7
- [X] Add more types tables/option/etc (1h) (31/7)
- [X] Experiment with a random merge that doesn't go above sizeIncreaseHint. (2h) 31/7
- [X] r.rand(bool) is missing, so make a PR and work on adding more merge overloads and testing (1h) 31/7
- [X] Find out how to disable coverage for the fuzzers functions.
- [X] Read libFuzzer mutator's source file.
- [X] Experiment with 'read unstructured bytes then use RNG to mutate them' idea. (3h) 3/8
- [X] Experiment with the idea of filling up with zeros and ignore len/maxLen. (1h) 4/8

- [ ] Fill up missing details in the spec such as distinct types, sets, refs. (2h)
- [ ] Safe enum mutator, needs a macro. (1h)
- [ ] Write more fuzz targets (2/?) (1h+)
- [ ] Implement mutator for simple objects (generic) ()
- [ ] Write a macro for supporting variant objects
- [ ] Create a rough prototype that uses the generic mutator.
- [ ] Scetch a serialization format that maps perfectly to Nim types. Canceled
- [ ] Prototype with the public API, defaultMutator(typ), fuzzTarget(it, typ), customMutator(it, typ, body) (1h+) 27/7
- [ ] Make it work with object variants.
- [ ] Try to adjust reservoir sampler to return k items.
- [ ] Begin writing new spec/code. (2h+) 30/7
- [ ] Work on two prototypes, one with 'recombine' + mutate other with merge + combine + mutate
- [ ] Finish the serialization from buffer to types.
- [ ] Write mutate overloads for most types + merge.
- [X] Research into fuzzcheck-rs/grimoire/etc and try to find ideas worth stealing. (overengineered) (4h) 1/8-8/8
- [ ] Idea: use minification as a way to 'benchmark' difference between only customMutator or together with crossover
- [X] Seems like usage of sizeIncreaseHint is wrong in the seq prototype need to investigate further. (2h) 8/8
- [ ] Start porting the graph example as that would give us more intuition in structure fuzzing than the current basic ones. (3h+) 7/8
- [X] Experiment with using LibFuzzer's mutate on every type of data (result should be truncated). (1h) 8/8
- [ ] Decide what would be the serialization API, should it return false on failure or fill with zeros?
- [ ] Test how viable is the distinct idea, instead of having to write crazy mutators. (4.5h+) 9/8-10/10
- [X] Tracked down the source (libFuzzer/FuzzerLoop) for the invalid inputs. (1h) 10/8
